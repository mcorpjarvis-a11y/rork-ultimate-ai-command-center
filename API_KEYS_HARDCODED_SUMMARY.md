# 🔐 API KEYS - HARDCODED vs USER-PROVIDED

## 🎯 Summary

**FREE AI APIs are NOT hardcoded** - You need to get your own free API keys (takes 10 minutes).

**WHY?** API keys are personal and shouldn't be shared in code. Each provider gives you FREE keys when you sign up.

---

## ✅ WHAT IS HARDCODED (Already Done)

These are pre-configured in the code and require NO action:

### 1. **API Endpoints** ✅
All base URLs and model IDs are hardcoded in `config/api.config.ts`:

```typescript
FREE_AI_MODELS = {
  groq: {
    baseURL: 'https://api.groq.com/openai/v1',  // ✅ Hardcoded
    models: {
      'llama-3.1-70b': 'llama-3.1-70b-versatile',  // ✅ Hardcoded
    }
  },
  huggingface: {
    baseURL: 'https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models',  // ✅ Hardcoded
    models: { /* All models hardcoded */ }
  },
  // ... all 5 providers configured
}
```

### 2. **Service Logic** ✅
Complete FreeAIService with:
- ✅ Rate limiting logic
- ✅ Automatic provider selection
- ✅ Fallback handling
- ✅ Error recovery
- ✅ Cost tracking

### 3. **Integration Setup** ✅
Plug & Play service with:
- ✅ Setup wizards for each provider
- ✅ Connection testing
- ✅ Status tracking
- ✅ Direct links to get keys

### 4. **Documentation** ✅
Complete guides:
- ✅ AI_KEYS_NEEDED.md - How to get every key
- ✅ FREE_AI_SETUP_COMPLETE.md - How everything works
- ✅ YOUR_TODO_NEXT_SESSION.md - What to do next

## 🔑 WHAT YOU NEED TO PROVIDE (User Action Required)

## 🎯 WHY NOT HARDCODE API KEYS?

### ❌ BAD (Hardcoding keys in code):
```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS:
const GROQ_API_KEY = "gsk_abc123xyz"; // NEVER hardcode!
```

**Problems:**
- 🔴 Keys get exposed in GitHub
- 🔴 Everyone uses same key = rate limits
- 🔴 If key leaks, everyone is affected
- 🔴 Can't customize usage per user
- 🔴 Violates provider Terms of Service

### ✅ GOOD (User provides their own):
```typescript
// This is what we do:
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const apiKey = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@free_ai_keys:groq');
// User adds their own key in the app
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Each user has their own rate limits
- ✅ Keys stay private
- ✅ No shared quota issues
- ✅ Follows best practices
- ✅ Complies with provider ToS

## 💰 COST BREAKDOWN
