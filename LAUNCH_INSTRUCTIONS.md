- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Bun** (Latest version) - Install with: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
- **Expo Go App** on your phone:
  - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
  - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

## üõ† Installation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Your Environment

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and run these commands to verify everything is installed:

```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
node --version

# Check Bun version
bun --version

# Check npm version
npm --version
```

If any of these commands fail, install the missing software from the links above.

---

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory

```bash
# If your project is in Documents/jarvis-project:
cd ~/Documents/jarvis-project

# Or wherever your project folder is located
# On Windows: cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\jarvis-project
```

---

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

This will install all the required packages (React Native, Expo, AI SDKs, etc.):

```bash
# Install all dependencies
bun install

# This might take 2-5 minutes depending on your internet speed
```

**What's happening:** Bun is downloading and installing ~50+ packages needed to run your app.

---

### Step 4: Login to Expo

```bash
# Login to your Expo account
bunx expo login

# Follow the prompts:
# - Enter your email
# - Enter your password
# - Confirm authentication
```

**Why:** Expo needs this to sync your app with your phone.

---

## üì± Running on Your Phone

### Method 1: Using Tunnel (Recommended - Works Anywhere)

This method works even if your phone and computer are on different networks:

```bash
# Start the development server with tunnel
bun start

# The console will show:
# - A QR code
# - Development server is running at http://...
# - Logs from your app
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.100:8081
‚Ä∫ Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)

‚Ä∫ Press a ‚îÇ open Android
‚Ä∫ Press i ‚îÇ open iOS simulator
‚Ä∫ Press w ‚îÇ open web

‚Ä∫ Press r ‚îÇ reload app
‚Ä∫ Press m ‚îÇ toggle menu
```

---

### Step 5: Connect Your Phone

#### For iOS (iPhone/iPad):

1. Open your **Camera app** (default camera)
2. Point it at the QR code in your terminal
3. A notification will pop up: "Open in Expo Go"
4. Tap the notification
5. **Expo Go will open and load your app** (takes 10-30 seconds first time)

#### For Android:

1. Open **Expo Go app** on your phone
2. Tap **"Scan QR Code"** at the bottom
3. Point camera at the QR code in your terminal
4. App will start loading (takes 10-30 seconds first time)

---

### Method 2: Using Local Network (Faster, but same WiFi required)

If your phone and computer are on the same WiFi:

```bash
# Start with local network
bun start --lan

# Same process as above - scan the QR code
```

**Pro tip:** This method is faster for development but requires same WiFi network.

---

### Method 3: Manual URL Entry

If QR code doesn't work:

1. Look for the URL in your terminal (something like `exp://192.168.1.100:8081`)
2. In Expo Go app:
   - Tap "Enter URL manually" at the bottom
   - Type or paste the URL
