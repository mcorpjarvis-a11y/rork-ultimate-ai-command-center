## 🔑 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (In Order)

### Step 1: Get These 5 FREE API Keys (10 minutes)

Go to each site, sign up (free), and copy the API key:

|---------|-----|------|--------------|
| 1. **Groq** | https://console.groq.com | 2 min | Fastest free AI (Llama 3.1) |
| 2. **Hugging Face** | https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens | 2 min | 100+ models |
| 3. **Together AI** | https://api.together.xyz/signup | 2 min | $5 free credit |
| 4. **DeepSeek** | https://platform.deepseek.com | 2 min | Best code AI |
| 5. **Google Gemini** | https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey | 2 min | Google's free AI |

**Save these keys in a text file** - You'll add them in the next step.

### Step 2: Add Keys to JARVIS (5 minutes)

1. Start the app:
   ```bash
   bun run start
   # or for web:
   bun run start-web
   ```

2. Open the app (browser or Expo Go)

3. Go to **API Keys** page (in sidebar)

4. For each key you got:
   - Click "Add New API Key" section
   - **Service name:** Type exact name (e.g., "Groq", "Hugging Face", "Together AI", "DeepSeek", "Gemini")
   - **API key:** Paste the key you copied
   - Click "Add Key"

5. After adding all 5, you should see them in "Your API Keys" list

---

### Step 3: Test Each Integration (5 minutes)

1. Still on **API Keys** page
2. Scroll to "Integration Setup & Tutorials"
3. Click each integration to expand
4. Click the **Test** button (🧪 icon)
5. Should see ✅ "Connected successfully!"

If any fail:
- Double-check the API key
- Make sure service name matches exactly
- Try regenerating the key on the provider's site

---

### Step 4: Try JARVIS! (Test everything works)

1. **Test Text Generation:**
   - Open AI Assistant (floating button or sidebar)
   - Type: "Explain quantum computing simply"
   - Should get fast response from free AI

2. **Test Code Generation:**
   - Ask: "Create a React button component"
   - Should use DeepSeek and generate code

3. **Test Content Creation:**
   - Go to Content Engine page
   - Generate a social media post
   - Check which free model was used

4. **Check Cost Tracking:**
   - Go to Overview Dashboard
   - Should see "Cost Saved" metrics
   - Free models should show $0 cost

---

## 📊 Expected Results

After completing steps 1-4, you should see:

- ✅ 5 free AI providers showing as "Connected"
- ✅ AI Assistant responding instantly
- ✅ Code generation working
- ✅ All costs showing as $0 (using free models)
- ✅ JARVIS is 90% operational!

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Can't add API keys:
- Make sure app is running
- Check API Keys page is visible
- Try refreshing the app

### Keys don't save:
- Check AsyncStorage permissions
- Try clearing app storage and re-adding
- Look for errors in console

### Test connections fail:
- Verify key is correct (copy-paste again)
- Check internet connection
- Wait a minute and retry
- Generate new key from provider

### AI responses don't work:
- Make sure at least one key is "Connected"
- Check rate limits (Groq has 30/min limit)
- Try different provider
- Check console for errors

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Start with just Groq** - Fastest to set up, fastest inference
2. **Add DeepSeek next** - Best for code generation
3. **Save your keys safely** - Don't lose them!
4. **Monitor rate limits** - Groq is fast but limited to 30/min
5. **Check console logs** - Lots of debugging info there

---

## 🎊 WHEN YOU'RE DONE

You'll have:
- ✅ JARVIS running 90% on FREE AI
- ✅ Saving ~$114/month vs OpenAI only
- ✅ 5 different AI providers as backups
- ✅ Automatic fallback and rate limiting
- ✅ Full cost tracking

**And you spent $0 on AI!**
